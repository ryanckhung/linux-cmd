# From other reference site, you should make the swapoff
The Kubernetes scheduler determines the best available node on which to deploy newly created pods. If memory swapping is allowed to occur on a host system, this can lead to performance and stability issues within Kubernetes. For this reason, Kubernetes requires that you disable swap in the host system.

# Important steps to kick it up.
1. turn off the swap
> sudo swapoff -a
2. turn off the firewall
3. try to reset kubeadm if give error
> sudo kebeadm reset
4. make sure the cgroup of k8s and docker are matched
# check docker cgroup by
> sudo docker info | grep -i cgroup
# you will see something like (in the following example "cgroupfs" is the cgroup for docker)
Cgroup Driver: cgroupfs
# goto kubeadm-config.yaml and the following line
cgroupDriver:cgroupfs
