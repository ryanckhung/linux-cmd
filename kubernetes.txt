Current trends and changes to the distributions have reduced some of the differences between the distributions.
* systemd (system startup and service management)
  systemd is used by the most common distributions, replacing the SysVinit and Upstart packages. Replaces service and chkconfig commands.
* journald (manags system logs)
  journald is a systemd service that collects and stores logging data. It creates and maintains structured, indexed journals based on logging information that is received from a variety of sources.
* firewalld (firewall management daemon)
  firewalld provides a dynamically managed firewall with support for network/firewall zones to define the trust level of network connections or interaces.
* ip (network display and configuration tool)
  the ip program is part of the net-tools package, and is designed to be a replacement for the ifconfig command. The ip command will show or manipluate routing, network devices, routing information and tunnels.
